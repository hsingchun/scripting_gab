The govt is full of those looking out for their overlords and not the American people like they were voted in or hired to do. We want folks immigrating here who can help build the country up not tear it down and suck up all the resources. For generations, immigrants from Europe and other developed countries came here to \"build\" a new future without govt handouts. Sorry folks but this flow from third world countries does little to build us up. What skills do they bring? Are they adding to our western culture or do they seek to pervert it and bring it down? It has worked for a few centuries so what's the problem. It was built by European immigrants then gradually those from the far east. This has worked. They didn't come from backward cultures that hate the way we do things in the west. Most sought to assimilate or at least build communities that added in postive ways to the culture. You can call me a racist but that doesn't stick. Note how I included our friends from the far east. I oppose third world cultures who don't support the prevailing culture of our nation. Why should any nation give up its culture and laws to suit those who oppose what is? If they oppose what is then don't immigrate here. Don't immigrate then try to make it just like the failed culture you escaped from. Just wanted to be able to give my views without being attacked for having thoughts of my own. Freedom of speech and thus freedom of thought are rights we have here unlike in numerous other places. Even England has the scourge of the \"thought police\" now. They chase politically incorrect thought and speech rather than going after the violent criminals that roam the streets with knives."}, {"author_id ": "5c781dadaaf6295f2b778587", "comment_id ": "5c781f05cae3862bf319e5e5", "comment": "Trump, time to sack up, boy!
