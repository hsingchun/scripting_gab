Religious agencies and organizations should not be forced to go against their beliefs and biblical standards. In this case, the city of Philadelphia was refusing to use a Catholic adoption agency because their religious beliefs prevent them from working with same-sex foster parents.

Godless socialism and communism are threatening our very way of life in this country and the inroads already made are shocking. Even though no one has fired a shot, the battle is raging and we\u2019d better wake up before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s like some people have blinders on and don\u2019t see the dangers of what is coming down the road.<br /><br />Yeonmi Park sees the dangers though. She was born in North Korea and fled the oppression, risking everything to find freedom. The journey was long and hard, but now in the United States, Yeonmi was excited to go to an Ivy League university where she thought free-thought flourished and she could learn and grow. But that\u2019s not what she found. Instead, the institution of higher learning was more concerned with political correctness and forcing her to think the way they wanted her to. She has been utterly shocked, saying it reminds her of the country she fled. They teach anti-Western sentiment, collective guilt, and suffocating political correctness. She was condemned for reading traditional American literature, saying that those authors were racists and bigots. Speaking three languages, she was dismayed when they said she must use incorrect pronouns like \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d rather than \u201chim\u201d and \u201cher\u201d to satisfy the gender police. Yeonmi said, \"It was chaos. It felt like the regression in civilization.\" She rightly accused American higher education institutions of stripping people\u2019s ability to think critically. <br /><br />Yeonmi told the media that it seems like \u201cpeople here are just dying to give their rights and power to the government. That is what scares me the most.\u201d That\u2019s what should scare us as well. It is said that, \u201cThe goal of socialism is communism.\u201d Communism has always been the enemy of the church. They executed thousands upon thousands of pastors, priests, and other religiously affiliated people throughout Russia, Eastern Europe, and China. Pray that God will spare us and that our political leaders will wake up to the enemy that is at the gate.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/north-korean-defector-ivy-league-nuts?fbclid=IwAR3UN7dkkhEU40FsDYHHZlQ6T3lH-AjjsmP4osJETVYuYy9nI6xRArdTb_U\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span>foxnews.com/us/north-korean-defector-ivy-leag<span class=\"invisible\">ue-nuts?fbclid=IwAR3UN7dkkhEU40FsDYHHZlQ6T3lH-AjjsmP4osJETVYuYy9nI6xRArdTb_U</span><span class=\"ellipsis\"></span></a>", "media_attachments": [], "tags": []}, {"post_id": "106411035215653252", "is_repost": "no", "replies_count": 6, "reblogs_count": 15, "favourites_count": 194, "content": "Fourteen years ago today, my mother, Ruth Bell Graham, went to Heaven.

She told the school board\u2014and now the world through national news\u2014that Critical Race Theory has its roots in cultural Marxism and it teaches children to loathe their country, actually fueling racism. It leads people to judge based on skin color. She warned that China used the same kind of critical theory to divide people during their \u201cCultural Revolution.\u201d She is exactly right\u2014\u201cFreedom is fragile, and we can lose it at any time if we don\u2019t defend it.\"<br />Critical Race Theory is a very dangerous socialist, communist idea that has now made it mainstream in our schools by school boards who are supporting this leftist socialist ideology. Parents must rise up against the school boards and let their voices be heard. I would encourage Christians in these communities to be involved and run for school boards.
